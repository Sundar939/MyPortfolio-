            <h3>Improving the Strength of Friction Stir Welded Joint by Double-Sided Welding for AA6065 (11/2021 - 03/2022)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Undertook a project to enhance the strength of friction stir welded joints in AA6065, a widely used aluminum alloy in aerospace and automotive industries.</li>
                <li>Selected optimal welding parameters such as tool rotation speed, traverse speed, and axial force based on the material and welding setup.</li>
                <li>Ensured thorough surface preparation of the material by cleaning and removing impurities or oxide.</li>
                <li>Executed simultaneous welding on both joint sides to diminish heat input and provide uniform welding.</li>
                <li>Employed adequate clamping and fixturing to prevent material movement or distortion during welding.</li>
                <li>Performed post-weld treatments like heat treatment, hot isostatic pressing, or surface finishing to facilitate the strength and integrity of the joint.</li>
                <li>Successfully bolstered the strength of the FSW joint for AA6065 through double-sided welding.</li>
